# [H1]: Package Management & Upgrades

This module covers two foundational topics for working with Move packages on Sui.

## Contents

### [Package Management](./package_management.md)

How Move packages are structured, configured, and published. Covers the manifest (`Move.toml`), dependency types, lock files, and key CLI commands.

### [Package Upgrades](./package_upgrades.md)

How to safely upgrade published packages while preserving on-chain state. Covers the upgrade flow, compatibility rules, versioned shared objects, and includes a **hands-on CLI exercise** using the `package_upgrade/` code.

## Exercise Code

The `package_upgrade/` directory contains a Hero game package used for the upgrade exercise. You will publish it as v1, train and level up heroes, then upgrade it to v2 to rebalance the training mechanics following the walkthrough in the upgrades guide.
